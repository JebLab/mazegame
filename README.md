## Introduction

### Synopsis
OLD:
A new student from Willams County Highschool is taken to the abandoned Hillman Industrail College and locked in by bullies. "HiC" was shuddered in the 1910s for reasons unknown but is assumed to have closed from the Flu Pandemic of 1918. Upon entering the school and exploring for abit the player suddenly transported to a twisted version of their highschool.

NEW: 
"Lost in the Backrooms" is a survival horror game where the player takes on the role of a person who has inexplicably fallen into a seemingly endless labyrinthine network of yellow, musty rooms and hallways, known as The Backrooms. The objective of the game is to navigate through the maze, find a way out, and avoid the hostile entities that reside within The Backrooms. The game's atmosphere is tense and unsettling, with eerie sounds and dim lighting adding to the feeling of claustrophobia and dread. As the player progresses, they will encounter various obstacles and puzzles, as well as gain access to new areas and tools to aid in their escape. However, the deeper the player ventures into The Backrooms, the more dangerous and unpredictable it becomes, with new and terrifying creatures lurking around every corner. The player's only hope is to keep moving forward and never look back, lest they become lost in the endless expanse of The Backrooms forever.
